=>It is an executional enviroment which is layer between Application component and operating system...
=>It convert the managed code into native code and then excute the program...

Q2.What is Static Keyword.
=>It is keyword to declaring to member of a type,specific to that type.

Q3.Difference between Break and Countinue statement.
=>Break: If we are using break statement then we jump out of the loop.
=>Countinue:If we are using Countinue statement then we jump out a cretain iteration and it again countinuing the excutions.

Q8.What is partial class.
=>It split the class defination into multiple classes ,either the same source code file or multiple code file.

Q9. What is Method Overloading.
=>Create a multiple method with a same name but different Signature.

Q10.What is methodoverriding.
=>If the derived class define same method as define the base class ,it is known as method Overriding.

Q11.What is difference between Method hiding and method overriding.
=>Method Hiding: In method hiding parent class variable always pointing to child class object and invoke the hidden
 method of parent class.
=> Method Overriding: In method overriding parent class variable is pointing to child class object and invoke the overriden child class.

Q12. What is Indexers.
=>Indexers allows our object to be used just like an array.

Q13. What is delegates.
=> Delegates is a type which holds the method reference in an object.
=> It will used to store the reference of a method.

Q14.What is dependency Injection.
=>Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern. It allows us to develop loosely-coupled code. 
The intent of Dependency Injection is to make code maintainable.
Dependency Injection helps to reduce the tight coupling among software components. 

Q15.What is diference between Managed code and unmanaged code.
=>                 Managed code                                  Unmanaged code
1.A code excuted by CLR insted of Operating system.       1.A code is excuted directly by the opearting system.
2.Runtime provieds services like garbage collector,       2.But in unmanaged code that type of servies are not avilable.
  exception handling etc.

Q16. What is assembly in .Net?
=>It is a logical unit of code and excuted by CLR.
=>It is collection nof of types and resources information which are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionlity.
Two types of Assemblies:-
1.exe file: When are creating Console or Windows Project,then .exe are created.
2.Dll file: when we are creating Web app project,then Dll are created. 

Q17.What is GAC(Global Assembly cache)?
=>

Q18.What is difference between Value type and reference type?
=>      value type                                            reference type
1.If variable store a value                              1. if a variable store a addresss.
2.Value type are created at compilation time.            2. Reference type are created at run time.
3.Value type are store in Stack memory                   3.reference type are store in heap memory.
